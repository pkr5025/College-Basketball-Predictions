# College-Basketball-Predictions

I created a model to predict the scores of college basketball games.
Done: 
* Write code to get a complete college basketball schedule of completed games
* Retrieve Vegas lines
* Implement a simple decision tree model
* Implement a simple random forest model

To do:
* Compare vegas lines vs my model
* Continue to improve the model and explore alternative models.
